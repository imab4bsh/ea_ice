The Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) mantains daily ice products: Concentration, Edge and Type.
I want to download all the historical data for the European Artic (66-90N between 25W-60E) to calculate statisics/climatological info for the region.
With this I will set search regions for selecting the "CTD" data for the ISA reference database (ISA-PTs-RD).
Each product has its own directory (subfolder structure is YEAR/MONTH). I select the netcdf version.
The download of the files is done in matlab. 
Data is selected geographically and stored.


About the Reference database
- P is pressure, T temperature and s salinity
- Other type of instruments will be allowed (XBT, etc).
